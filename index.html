 <h1> CISC 3630 Clickteam Fusion project </h1>
  <h2> Project description </h2>
  <p>Using Clickteam Fusion Free </p>
  <p>Set the dimensions so the screen looks good in portrait mode on a phone.
</p>
  <p>Design a scene with a background and place at least 5 objects to "Pop". Can be a balloon, tresure chest, ghosts, windows, doors, etc. Something to "pop open".
 </p>
  <p>It's also interesting to make it something educational, such as if you want to have text appear next to something to learn more about it when you click on it.
 </p>
  <p>Make will be at least 5 "Active Objects" in the program.
</p>
  <p>Place the objects in your scene, so they look natural on the background. Make an event for the Mouse/Keyboard so that when "A user clicks on an object" the object changes it's animation (or frame if you want) to pop and change. Such as a balloon can pop, a ghost can burst, etc. You can make it interesting to make something appear, like if the balloon pops, something is revealed. You can even have various frames to show a random item by changing to a random value, if you like. When the object pops, make an appropriate sound.
</p>
  <p>Have an intro scene, with your name, title, and instructions, with a button to click to change the scene to the "Game". Have some music on that screen.
</p>
  <p>Have a restart button on the game scene, to retart the current scene. The game scene should have background music.
